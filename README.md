I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by frequently performing tests throughout the development process. Static testing tools can be used to find known security vulnerabilities in my project’s dependencies. Functionality can be tested using various testing methods such as unit testing and integration testing.

Interpreting user needs to incorporate them into a program is an essential skill for a member of a software development team. The most basic way to ensure that a user’s needs are met are to study the software requirements prior to writing any code. Software requirements are determined based on user needs and serve as an excellent starting point for a software developer. Because the software requirements have a huge influence over what gets developed, it is crucial that the requirements for a software project are clearly stated and accurate.

I approach software development with the user of the new program in mind. While it is important to look at a project from the perspective of a developer or engineer, I find it helpful to keep the eventual users of a program in mind. If I think of thing purely in terms of software development, I might lay things out in a way that makes sense to programmers, but this may not necessarily be the way that makes the most sense to the person using the program once it enters production.
